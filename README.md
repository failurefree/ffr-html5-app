-- Title --
Failure Free Reading's HTML5 web application for iPads

-- Design Goal --
Ultimately this HTML5 version of the Failure Free Reading Online app will be a SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) in which all parts of the application design will be designed as a service. The only way to access or operate on a service will be via an API or library of functions. The basic functional that all services must contain are the CRUD operators (i.e., CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE).  All other functionally is extra and shall be added as need per the software architects design specs.  No service shall be accessible directly by any other service.
